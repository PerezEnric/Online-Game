## Space Battle

This is a game where every player controls a spaceship and has to kill each enemy. The player who kills the most will win.

## Controls

* ARROW UP: Accelerate
* ARROW LEFT/RIGHT: turn the spaceship
* SPACEBAR: shoot

## Features

* Enric: UDP virtual connection (completely achived) and World State Replication (achieved with some known bugs)

A strange bug that sometimes appears is when you try to connect with the second type of spaceship, it doesn't replicate its state. But if you connect another player with another spaceship after that, then the player with the second type will see his/her screen that works well. Sincerely, I don't know why does this occur.
